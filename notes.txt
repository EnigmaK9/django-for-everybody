from socket import *

def createServer():
    serversocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    try:
    serversocket.listen(5)
    while(1):
        (clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()

        rd = clientsocket.recv(5000).decode()
        pieces = rd.split("\n")
        if ( len(pieces) > 0 ) : print(pieces[0])

        data = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
        data += "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n"
        data += "\r\n"
        data += "<html><body>Hello World</body></html>\r\n\r\n"
        clientsocket.sendall(data.encode())
        clientsocket.shutdown(SHUT_WR)

    except KeyboardInterrupt :
        print("\nShutting down...\n");
    except Exception as exec :
